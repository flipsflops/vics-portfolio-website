# Victor's Portfolio Website

## Introduction

I'm a Software Engineer focused on delivering products that impact. I enjoy product-driven work to help business ideas find traction. Business targets hit and people positively impacted serve as drive and inspiration for me. Always eager for a good conversation on design principles and terrible programming jokes.
